# Azure Virtual Machine & Azure File Share Assignment

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the creation and management of a Linux Virtual Machine in Microsoft Azure and the integration of Azure File Share.

The objective of this assignment was to understand:

- Virtual Machine deployment in Azure
- Network configuration (NSG rules)
- Web server installation and publishing
- Database installation and configuration
- Azure File Share creation and mounting using CIFS
- File operations between VM and Azure Storage

---

## ☁️ 1️⃣ Virtual Machine Creation

- Created a Linux (Ubuntu) Virtual Machine
- Configured authentication (username & password)
- Connected using Azure Bastion

---
## 🌐 2️⃣ Apache Web Server Installation

Installed Apache inside the VM:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install apache2 -y
```

Opened port 80 in Network Security Group.

Verified by accessing:
```
http://PUBLIC-IP
```

Result: Apache default page displayed successfully.

---
## 🐬 3️⃣ MySQL Installation

Installed MySQL:
```
sudo apt install mysql-server -y
```

Created database:
```
CREATE DATABASE assignmentdb;
SHOW DATABASES;
```

Result: Database created successfully.

---
## 💾 4️⃣ Azure File Share

Created Storage Account

Created File Share named "myshare"

Mounted using CIFS to /mnt/myshare

Tested file operations:
```
sudo touch test.txt
sudo rm test.txt
```
Result: File successfully created and deleted.
Verified in Azure Portal.

---
## 🔐 5️⃣ Network Configuration

Added inbound rule:

- Port: 80

- Protocol: TCP

- Action: Allow

This allowed public access to Apache.
